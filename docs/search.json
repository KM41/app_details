    "text": "This app calculates playing handicap for various individual and team formats and includes adjustments for mixed tees. The handicap calculations are based on the WHS Rules of Handicapping and the accompanying Guidance Documents. The recommended handicap allowances and mixed tee adjustments have been applied for all formats. The default settings are currently applicable to GB&I. This app is not endorsed by any golf governing bodies.\nSelect a golf club, tees and playing format from dropdown lists. Enter multiple Handicap Indexes between -6.0 and 54.0 separated by space or comma. Players are ordered and grouped into teams based on the order of handicap indexes entered. Playing handicaps for teams are given against the last player on each team.\nA list of the course rating data for a selection of golf courses sourced from the USGA Course Rating and Slope Database is available for users to add from. Once added, the data may be updated for accuracy. Users may also save new courses and tees by adding the Course Rating (CR), Slope Rating (SR) and par for each tee In this app, any mixed tee adjustments are made by adding strokes against the tee with the lowest rating measures. These adjustments may therefore differ if another set of tees with lower ratings was also used and/or a different method of adjustment was applied in a wider competition.\n\n\n\nThe handicap calculations are based on the WHS Rules of Handicapping and the accompanying Guidance Document as applied to GB and Ireland.\n18-hole CH = HI x SR/113 [GB&I]\n18-hole CH = HI x (SR/113) + (CR - Par) [other]\n9-hole CH = (HI/2) x (SR/113) + (CR - Par)\nPH = (CH x Handicap Allowance) + (adjustment for mixed tees)\nFor individual and team competitions played from mixed/multiple tees, adjustments to the PH or TH may be made to achieve equity when the CR and/or par for the tees are different. The adjustments also take into account the method of calculating CH, the competition format and the scoring method. The adjusted handicaps are labeled with an s for stableford scoring (using own par and SI) and m for medal scoring. The medal scoring method is applied in standard matchplay formats\nWhen CH includes CR-Par, the points needed to play to handicap are equal across all the tees. Hence mixed tee adjustments for stableford scoring are not required. Adjustments for medal scoring are based on the difference in pars\nIn this app, any adjustments are made by adding strokes against the tee with the lowest rating measures. These adjustments may therefore differ if another set of tees with lower ratings was also used and/or a different method of adjustment was applied in a wider competition. For mixed greensomes/foursomes stableford formats, the adjustments for mixed tees are based on points to play to handicap using a common par as players score from a single set of tees. The order of the HIs determine the teams and the TH is given against the last player on the team. The final playing handicaps are rounded to a whole number after applying handicap allowances to CH and adding any adjustments for mixed tees.\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, please contact us at whs.calculator@gmail.com"
